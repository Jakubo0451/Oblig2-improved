## Illustrator
Before we started exporting to SVGs we had to do a bit of cleanup in the adobe illustrator. First of all, the background colors and the earth were expanding beyond the artboard, so we needed to cut that out. For the sake of simplicity, we have also removed all the other irrelevant elements from the file (reference photos and the 2nd poster). Our solution also included drawing the eyes of the earth and then animating them, so we cut them out of the original poster and covered the holes with appropriate colors. Some of the elements provided were also not grouped together, so again for the sake of making it an easier export we have grouped them.
## Background
In order to replicate the poster, the best we can and stay as close to the original as possible we have done several things. First, following the best practices (found on the presentation from 22 of march) the SVGs that were not animated were simply implemented using a path to the file. The exported background includes all colored segments and the earth without its eyes. We have also not exported any text provided. The rest of the elements that were not being animated also were exported as an SVG. We have done so because the task required us to export things separately and also because the animations make the elements change their original positions, therefore we needed to have them separately in order to fix their position in relation to the newly added animations. We positioned those elements by giving the main background element relative position and everything else inside it, position absolute. We used top, left, right and top for position and to ensure responsiveness we used view width for positioning.
## Text
We have used the same font which was called “Marydale” and its bold version. This font was used throughout the entire poster with the exception of the main headline. We have found out that the font used for it was called “Iwata Gothic Old Std Hv” which it not an adobe font and costs around 150 USD. Because of that we decided to use the closest possible match which was just “Arial”. As we have mentioned before, the texts included in our version were not exported, but similarly to the not animated elements we given them position absolute and positioned them with view width.
## Animations
We planned out which elements were suitable for implementation of animation, to find what animation techniques were necessary for the result we wanted to achieve. The best options were the earth's eyes, the moon, the two stars and the people on the earth. Our plans were to do CSS drawing to create the earth's eyes, so that was the first CSS animation we implemented, to scale the two divs. We considered CSS animations for the stars, but it was better to implement an animation using SMIL there. The two stars move along a path at different speeds to make them desynchronize. For the car flying to the moon we used a CSS animation, which also let us make the tires spin in bursts, making the car look like it's in a timeloop rather than just being stationary. Our last animation was for the people on the earth where we simply made them move up and down to breathe some life into the characters.
